 📊 Dashboard Overview

This interactive dashboard provides a clear and intuitive visualization of employee attrition across different categories such as salary range, education, job role, age group, and department.

It was designed to help HR teams and decision-makers identify key patterns behind employee turnover and take data-informed actions to improve retention.

The report includes the following insights:

- Total number of employees and attrition count
- Attrition rate across key segments (job role, salary, age, education, etc.)
- Average salary, age, and tenure
- Department-level filters for more granular analysis

 🎯 Project Goals

- Help businesses identify the most affected groups in terms of attrition
- Understand whether salary, education, or experience influence turnover
- Provide a visually engaging and actionable report for HR teams

Data Cleaning & Preparation

All data cleaning was done within Power BI's Power Query Editor using:

- Column renaming and standardization
- Grouping and summarizing metrics
- Creating calculated columns like `Attrition_Count` and `AgeGroup`
- Filtering unnecessary columns
- Ensuring clean relationships between fact and dimension tables

🧩 Data Model

The report uses a star schema for clean data structure:

- Fact Table: `HR_Data` (central dataset with all metrics)
- Dimension Tables:
  - `Departments`
  - `Jobs`
  - `Education`

Each table is connected with a one-to-many relationship using proper keys.
